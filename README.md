The app is called Affirmation Oasis. Its purpose is to provide users with a daily dose of positivity and good news. Hereâ€™s what it does:

Daily Content Card: Each day, the app displays a full-screen card with an uplifting quote, act of kindness, or a piece of good news. This card uses a gentle fade-in animation for a calming effect.
Push Notifications: Users receive a daily notification at 8AM (local time) reminding them to view their daily positive message.
Favorites System: Users can save their favorite daily entries by tapping a heart icon and view them in a special "Favorites" list.
Archive View (Premium): Free users can see up to 7 past daily cards; unlocking the full archive requires a one-time premium purchase.
Sharing: Users can easily share the daily card as an image or text, optimized for Instagram and TikTok stories.
Settings Page: Includes options to toggle notifications, switch between light/dark themes, and send feedback.
AI Good News Summary: The app uses an AI tool to summarize positive news articles, delivering users a short blurb about world news and positive change.
The design focus is on serenity, minimalism, and a calming user experience, using soft colors and subtle animations. The backend relies on Firebase for storage and Next.js for the frontend.
