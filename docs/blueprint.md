## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Pale grayish-blue (#EBF0F5), suggesting serenity and openness.
- Primary color: Soft lavender (#B3AEC2), offering a sense of calm and subtle sophistication. This color will provide enough contrast in a light-themed design without being jarring.
- Accent color: Dusty rose (#D9A6A0), analogous to lavender, will draw the eye while remaining harmonious. The slightly increased saturation and lower brightness than the primary, compared to the background color will create a pleasing contrast.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' sans-serif. Body font: 'Poppins' sans-serif.
- Utilize minimalist, outlined icons with rounded corners to match the overall soft aesthetic.
- Employ generous whitespace and rounded corners to create a calming and inviting user interface.
- Incorporate subtle micro-animations, such as a gentle card fade-in and a heart pulsing effect for favorites, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
